1. Reown (WalletConnect Inc.) — Technical Overview

Reown is the new name for WalletConnect Inc. and represents the modern identity of the WalletConnect ecosystem.
They provide SDKs enabling developers to build advanced Web3 applications and wallets with minimal friction.

Why Reown matters for builders

Reown/AppKit wraps the complexity of WalletConnect 2.0 specs and exposes:

ready-to-use UX components
